# 3 Laws of Acquisition (3loa)

A framework consisting of **three sequential steps** that utilize **two essential conditions** for acquisition of knowledge/skill.

Two essential conditions are the following:

* `Comprehensible input` 
> Input not 'comprehensible' to a learner cannot be learned nor acquired.

* `Low filter` - (1) Motivation (2) Self-Confidence (3) Anxiety
> High motivation, self-confidence and low anxiety weaken the strength of filter that prevents input from getting past and reaching a learner. (Note that type two acculturation can help lower anxiety as well.)

Three sequential steps consist of the following stages:

1. `Memorization` - Comprehensible input 

2. `Familiarization` - Lower filter 

3. `Application` - Advance 


Acquisition-Learning Distinction
---------
* `Acquisition` - CAN generate additional knowledge / Subconscious

* `Learning` - CANNOT generate additional knowledge / Conscious

> "... The best methods are therefore those that supply 'comprehensible input' in low anxiety situatons..."

> "... The input hypothesis says the opposite. It says we acquire by 'going for meaning' first, and as a result, we acquire structure!"

> "... Real acquisition comes only from comprehensible input."

> "The Affective Filter hypothesis implies that our pedagogical goals should not only include supplying comprehensible input, but also 
creating a situation that encourages a low filter."

> "The effective language teacher is someone who can provide input and help make it comprehensible in a low anxiety situations."

> "...the classroom should help only to the extent it supplies comprehensible input in an environment conducive to a low filter."

> "The explanations for these observed differences (between adult and children) that seem most plausible to me involve input and the level or strength of the affective filter."

> "First, it claims that child-adult differences in attainment are not due to any change in the "language acquisition device" (LAD) but are due to the filter, a factor that is, in a snese, external to the LAD. Second, it is consistent with the claim that adults are still 'acquirers,' that they retain the natural language acquisition capacity children have."

> "In type one acculturation, the learner is socially integrated with the TL group and, as a result, develops sufficient contact with TL speakers to enable him to acquire the TL. In addition, he is psychologically open to the TL such that input to which he is exposed becomes intake. Type two acculturation has all the characteristics of type one, but in this case the learner regards the TL speakers as a reference group whose life styles and values he consciously or unconsciously desires to adopt."

> "It may be the case that acculturation is the most effective way of lowering the affective filter and getting input for immigrants and long-term visitors."
